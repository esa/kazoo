Demo_BlackBox

This demo shows how to use blackbox devices with parameters encoded in ACN and uPER
The BB device parameters are received in binary format (not decoded) and can be sent as is to the physical device.
The interface to the BB Device is synchronous (unprotected). It could be asynchronous...
There are two callers, one in C and one in Ada, and the build is done for both runtimes (C and Ada)
