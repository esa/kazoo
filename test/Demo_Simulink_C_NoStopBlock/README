Demo_Simulink_C_NoStopBlock

This Demo does not use any STOP block in the Simulink model. 
As a consequence, RTW/EC does not generate any definition for the macro called rtmGetStopRequested.


This test verifies that our glue detects that this macro is absent and therefore does not try to "call" it.
